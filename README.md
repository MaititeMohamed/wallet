#  wallet A new Flutter project

Wallet is much more than a bank, it is a platform that reimagines financial services for a globalized world, throwing out old-fashioned banks and clunky software.

After implementing a micro-service architecture on the backend, the company now wants to introduce a user interface that will allow users to manage their portfolios from their mobile phones.

The mobile application must meet the following requirements:

- A login and registration page.
- A home interface that displays the user's balance and a list of recent transactions.
- An interface for managing transactions (debit or withdrawal).
- A user area for modifying personal information.

You are required to use the Flutter framework while ensuring the maintenance of the criteria mentioned below:

- Create a work plan for the application with the different tasks using JIRA .
- Use a version control software (GIT).
- Create the different interfaces via Flutter.
  Consume the Wallet micro-service APIs via DART.
